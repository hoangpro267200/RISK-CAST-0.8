## LAYER 2: ELEVATOR PITCH (30 Seconds)

### Framework: Problem → Solution → Proof → Ask

### Standard Version

> "Every year, $50 billion is lost to logistics delays and cargo damage. Companies have no scientific way to predict which shipments are high-risk before they ship.
>
> RISKCAST solves this with the first calibrated risk engine for logistics - combining fuzzy decision science, Monte Carlo simulation, and 2,000+ historical shipments to predict delay probability with 87% accuracy.
>
> We've helped companies reduce delay-related costs by 30% and save $250k+ annually.
>
> We're raising a seed round to expand from NCKH competition winner to Series A. Can I send you our deck?"

### Insurance Version

> "Marine cargo insurers currently price risk using outdated methods - either manual underwriting (slow) or simple checklists (inaccurate).
>
> RISKCAST provides actuarial-grade risk scores in 30 seconds, enabling dynamic pricing. Underwriters using RISKCAST improve their combined ratio by 8-15 points while handling 3x more policies.
>
> We're the only calibrated, logistics-specific risk engine. Three insurers are piloting now.
>
> Would you like to see a demo for your underwriting team?"

### Investor Version

> "$200 billion flows through global logistics annually, but there's no 'FICO score' for shipments. Forwarders, insurers, and shippers all guess at risk.
>
> RISKCAST is building the risk intelligence layer - starting with shipment-level scoring, expanding to portfolio analytics and data marketplaces.
>
> We have 50 pilots running, $120k ARR, and Stanford-calibrated models. Raising $2M seed to hit $1M ARR in 12 months.
>
> Are you investing in supply chain tech?"

## LAYER 5: SALES PITCH (10-15 Minutes)

### Framework: Challenger Sale Method

### Part 1: Warm-Up (2 min)
> "Thanks for taking the time. Before I jump in, can you tell me a bit about your current risk assessment process?
>
> [Listen - take notes]
>
> Got it. And what happens when a high-risk shipment slips through? What's the typical cost?"

### Part 2: Teach for Differentiation (3 min)
> "Here's what we've learned working with similar companies:
>
> Most risk assessment falls into one of three buckets:
>
> 1. **Manual/Gut Feel** - Pro: leverages expertise. Con: Inconsistent, slow.
>
> 2. **Simple Checklists** - Pro: Fast. Con: Doesn't capture interactions.
>
> 3. **ML Black Boxes** - Pro: High accuracy. Con: Unexplainable, regulators reject.
>
> The missing category is **Calibrated Scientific Scoring:**
> - Transparent methodology (fuzzy logic + multi-criteria analysis)
> - Captures factor interactions (Monte Carlo simulation)
> - Validated against actuals (calibration against 2,000+ outcomes)
> - Fast (30 seconds) + explainable (audit trail)
>
> This is what RISKCAST provides."

### Part 3: Reframe Their Situation (2 min)
> "Based on what you shared, it sounds like you're probably:
> - Underpricing low-risk shipments (leaving money on table)
> - Overpricing high-risk ones (losing competitive bids)
> - Occasionally missing a high-risk shipment entirely
>
> Does that resonate?
>
> The reason isn't lack of effort - it's that human judgment can't handle 13+ interacting risk factors."

### Part 4: Tailored Solution (4 min)
> "[Screen share live demo]
>
> I'll use the Shanghai → LA shipment you mentioned:
>
> [Enter details, click Analyze]
>
> **Risk Score: 67.5** (Medium-High)
> **Delay Probability: 18%**
> **Expected Loss: $12,500**
>
> Now, let's dig into WHY:
> - Weather risk: 65/100 (typhoon season)
> - Route risk: 55/100 (port congestion)
> - Carrier risk: 40/100 (12% delay rate on this lane)
>
> [Show tornado diagram]
>
> [Show scenario comparison]
>
> If we delay 5 days, risk drops to 48. If we switch to air, drops to 32."

### Part 5: Proof (2 min)
> "Here's our validation:
> - Backtested on 2,000 historical shipments
> - 87% accuracy identifying high-risk shipments
> - Mean Absolute Error: 12.3 points
>
> [Show calibration curve]
>
> **Customer Results:**
> - Company X: 30% reduction in delay costs
> - Company Y: 15% reduction in insurance premiums"

### Part 6: Next Steps (1 min)
> "**Option 1: Pilot (30 days)**
> - Score your next 50 shipments
> - Track results vs actuals
> - No commitment
>
> **Option 2: Side-by-Side Test**
> - Score your last 20 shipments
> - Compare to your internal scores
> - Takes 1 hour
>
> What makes more sense for you?"

## OBJECTION-READY SOUNDBITES

### "How accurate is it?"
> "87% accuracy in identifying high-risk shipments, validated on 2,000 historical outcomes. Our Mean Absolute Error is 12.3 points on a 0-100 scale."

### "Why should I trust your model?"
> "Because we calibrate against actual outcomes. Most risk tools use assumed weights - ours are optimized against what actually happened."

### "We already have internal scoring."
> "Great - let's compare. Pick 20 shipments, score them both ways, see which was more accurate. We've done this with other customers and won every time."

### "This is too expensive."
> "One prevented incident pays for 3 years of RISKCAST. At $15k/year, you need to avoid just one $50k delay to be ahead."

### "We need more features."
> "What specific problem would that feature solve? Let's see if we can solve it with current capabilities first."
