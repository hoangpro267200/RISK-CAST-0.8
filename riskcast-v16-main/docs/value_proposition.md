# RISKCAST Value Proposition

## Executive Summary

**RISKCAST** is an AI-powered logistics risk intelligence platform that transforms how supply chain professionals assess, predict, and mitigate cargo risk. By combining Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP), TOPSIS multi-criteria analysis, and Monte Carlo simulation, RISKCAST delivers enterprise-grade risk assessment in seconds—not hours.

## The Problem

### Current State of Logistics Risk Assessment

1. **Manual, Time-Intensive Process**
   - Risk assessment takes 4-6 hours per complex shipment
   - Relies on individual analyst expertise and judgment
   - Inconsistent quality across team members

2. **Reactive Rather Than Proactive**
   - Problems identified after they occur
   - Limited visibility into emerging risks
   - No real-time monitoring capabilities

3. **Suboptimal Insurance Costs**
   - Blanket coverage regardless of actual risk
   - Inability to negotiate risk-based premiums
   - High claims ratios due to poor risk selection

4. **Hidden Costs of Delays and Losses**
   - 15-20% of shipments experience delays
   - 3-5% experience cargo damage or loss
   - Customer relationships damaged by unreliability
